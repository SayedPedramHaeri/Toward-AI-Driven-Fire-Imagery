## üîç Overview
This folder contains the implementation and benchmarking results of **ResNet-50** for wildfire image classification.  
ResNet-50, a deep residual convolutional neural network, is used to distinguish between **fire** and **non-fire** scenes across multiple wildfire datasets. The model is implemented using the official **torchvision.models** library in PyTorch with pretrained ImageNet weights.  
Experiments focus on evaluating classification accuracy, robustness to environmental noise, and dataset generalization under diverse imaging conditions.
