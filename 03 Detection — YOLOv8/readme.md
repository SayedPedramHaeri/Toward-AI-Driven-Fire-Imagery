## üîç Overview
This folder contains the implementation and benchmarking results of **YOLOv8** for wildfire and smoke detection. YOLOv8 was integrated via the official **Ultralytics PyTorch** framework, which provides pretrained detectors trained on **COCO** and straightforward APIs for **fine-tuning**. The model is evaluated on multiple wildfire datasets to detect **fire** and **smoke regions** in RGB imagery. Performance metrics include **mAP@0.5**, **Precision**, **Recall**, and **F1-score**, along with **cross-dataset generalization** across unseen environments.
