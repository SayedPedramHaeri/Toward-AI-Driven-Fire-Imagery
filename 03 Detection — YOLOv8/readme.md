## üîç Overview
This section contains benchmarking of **YOLOv8**, an advanced object detection architecture optimized for **real-time wildfire and smoke detection**.  
The model is implemented through the official **Ultralytics PyTorch** framework using pretrained COCO weights and fine-tuned on wildfire datasets.  
Metrics such as precision, recall, and mAP are used to evaluate performance, highlighting YOLOv8‚Äôs efficiency in detecting fire regions in aerial and ground-based imagery.
