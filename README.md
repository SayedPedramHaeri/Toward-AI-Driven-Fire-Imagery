# Toward AI-Driven Fire Imagery: Attributes, Challenges, Comparisons, and the Promise of VLMs and LLMs  

A comprehensive repository accompanying the paper **_Toward AI-Driven Fire Imagery: Attributes, Challenges, Comparisons, and the Promise of VLMs and LLMs_ (2025)**. This repository provides code, datasets, and analyses supporting our large-scale review of wildfire and smoke imagery resources, and their integration with both traditional **Computer Vision (CV)** and modern **Vision-Language Models (VLMs)** and **Large Language Models (LLMs)**. It is intended for researchers, practitioners, and students interested in dataset benchmarking, computer-vision-based wildfire management, and multimodal perception.

## 🔍 Overview  

Despite major advances in technology-driven fire-management systems, global wildfire frequency and severity continue to rise—exacerbated by climate change and limited resource allocation. This work addresses the need for intelligent, data-driven fire-monitoring frameworks powered by AI and **Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAV)**. We review, organize, and compare all significant wildfire datasets released over the last 20 years (**RGB, thermal, IR, acoustic, chemical, multimodal**), analyzing their structure, annotation, and usability for modern AI tasks. The study also explores how emerging **LLMs and VLMs** can accelerate the **creation, augmentation, and application** of fire datasets for early detection, spread prediction, and post-incident assessment.

## 📌 What You’ll Find Here  

1. 🔥 **All existing fire and smoke datasets (2005–2025)** — curated and categorized by sensor type, modality, and application.  
2. 🧠 **Vision-based classification benchmarks** using ResNet-50 on standard RGB datasets.  
3. 🧩 **Vision-based segmentation analysis** using DeepLab-V3 for pixel-level smoke and flame mapping.  
4. 🎯 **Vision-based detection experiments** using YOLOv8 on aerial and ground-view datasets.  
5. 💡 **Vision-Language classification** with CLIP for multimodal understanding and zero-shot recognition.  
6. 🌐 **Vision-Language detection** with Grounding-DINO for open-vocabulary fire and smoke localization.  

Each implementation includes evaluation scripts, pretrained checkpoints (when available), and cross-dataset benchmarking utilities.
