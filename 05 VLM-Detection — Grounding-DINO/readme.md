## 🔍 Overview
This folder includes the **Grounding-DINO** implementation for **open-vocabulary object detection** of fire and smoke phenomena.  
Grounding-DINO integrates vision and language modalities to perform **natural-language–driven detection**, enabling flexible prompts such as “find smoke in the image.”  
Experiments are based on the official **IDEA-Research** PyTorch repository using pretrained checkpoints. Evaluation focuses on localization accuracy, detection recall, and generalization to unseen wildfire scenes.
