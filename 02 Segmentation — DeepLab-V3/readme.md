## üîç Overview
This directory includes experiments based on **DeepLab-V3**, a state-of-the-art semantic segmentation model used for **pixel-level fire and smoke delineation**.  
The model leverages atrous spatial pyramid pooling (ASPP) to capture multi-scale contextual information. All implementations utilize **torchvision.models.segmentation** with pretrained COCO weights.  
The experiments evaluate segmentation quality, IoU performance, and cross-dataset transferability for wildfire imagery.
